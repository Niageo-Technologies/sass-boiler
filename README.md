# Spacecraft ðŸš€
A bootstrap-like css framework made for developers that follow BEM css conventions, style guide or rules.

## What it includes
- A customizable Bootstrap-like grid system (made with flexbox and css grid) that can be used in your projects. The only difference is then naming system for the classes.
  Eg. `col-md-12` === `col--md-12`

- Normalize Css as well as other simple HTML resets that removes margin/padding from the page, removes decoration from links and adds `box-sizing: border-box` rule to everything on the page
